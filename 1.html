if you take too long to hit me back
I cant promise you how I'll react
but all that I can say is at least I'll wait for you
lately I've been on a rollar coaster tryna get a hold of my emotions
but all that I know is I need you close And i'ma scream and shout for what I love
passionate but I don't give no fucks I admit that i'm a lil' messed up
but I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
i'm ossessive and I love too hard good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far this far</p>

I can be needy so hard to please me I know it feels so good to be needed</p>
